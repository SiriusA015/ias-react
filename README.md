If for some reason start.sh is not working it could be because a container or volume got corrupted.
Please run the reset.sh script and once that has finished running you can run start.sh again.

### Use docker compose
- Run the following command in the IAS-project folder to start all backend services
  ```sh
  # If this is the first time running this command it will take some time while the docker images are downloaded.
  # Future uses will be very fast.
  $ docker compose up
  ``` ( *** On ubuntu - use : docker-compose build, docker-compse up -d)
- To start a development version of the front end, please input the following commands.
  ```sh
  $ cd react
  
  # this will install all modules and could take some time
  $ npm install 
  
  # this will build and serve the project.
  $ npm start 
  ```
